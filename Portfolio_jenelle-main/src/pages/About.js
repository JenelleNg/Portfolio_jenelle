                I am Jenelle. I'm currently a student in Republic Polytechnic Design, Digital and
                Development, SOI, graduating in 2026. I am passionate about creating user-centered 
                digital solutions through full-stack development, UI/UX design, and emerging technologies 
                such as AR/VR and AI. I approach challenges with creativity, innovation, and teamwork
                in agile environments, and I am particularly interested in AI—how it is programmed
                and how it can enhance user experiences to solve real-world problems.
